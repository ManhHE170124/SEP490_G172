> A platform for selling digital accounts/software keys with **automatic payments**, **automatic key delivery**, **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**, and **audit logging**.

---

## 🧩 What’s This Project?

A web application (Frontend + Backend) that enables:
- **Guests/Customers**: browse products, purchase, pay, receive keys automatically, create support tickets.
- **Admin/Support/Content/Storage Staff**: manage catalog, key inventory, blog content, tickets, reports, and permissions.

Goal: reduce fraud, shorten post-payment handling time, keep key inventory clean, and provide transparent user support.

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

By exploring this repo, you will practice:
- **Web API** design: REST (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE), HTTP status codes, JSON.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Sign-in, **JWT (JSON Web Token)**, screen/module-level **RBAC**.
- **Data & Inventory**: product, key, order, payment modeling; **no duplicate keys**; expiry/low-stock handling.
- **Support Flows**: ticketing (traceability, assignment), optional **real-time chat**.
- **Observability & Security**: **audit logs**, backup/restore, **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** configuration.
